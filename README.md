## removeGhosts.ps1
I found the original version of this script [here](https://theorypc.ca/2017/06/28/remove-ghost-devices-natively-with-powershell/?unapproved=10049&moderation-hash=10c8951dd7472325cbcaeed99af2ec9e).
Thank you for TrententTye and Alexander Boersch for their excellent work!

In this repo I publish a slightly improved version of this script which adds:
1. -narrowByClass,
1. -narrowByFriendlyName,
1. -force, making the default run asking for confirmation,
1. and the ablitiy to apply the optional filters for the non-destructive, listing runs as well.

Enjoy!
